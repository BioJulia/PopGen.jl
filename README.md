## Notice!
This package is in what you might call "aggresive early development". We break things **all the time** in the other branches and occassionally merge those changes with `Master`. Right now, we're in the process of completely changing the data structure from wide-DataFrames to long-IndexedTables, and that's a large piece of work to implement that (and fix every function thereafter to work with the new format). Please bear with us during these changes!  

#### How to install:
Invoke the package manager by pressing `]` on an empty line and `add` this repo
