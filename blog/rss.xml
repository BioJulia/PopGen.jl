            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<link rel="stylesheet" href="/PopGen.jl/katex/katex.min.css"><h1>A bit about FST</h1><p>If you have spent any time being exposed to population genetics, you've likely encountered the term  <em>FST</em>, our field's most beloved/maligned one-size-fits all coefficient. That description is a gross oversimplification, but the purpose of this post isn't to dig deep into the world of differentiation statistics, but instead shed light on the general concept and the logic behind its significance testing. </p><p>If you're like me, you've used and reported some kind of pairwise <strong>X</strong>ST statistic in your work, where that value was generated using some fantastic software like <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/adegenet/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adegenet</a> or <a href="https://www.bentleydrummer.nl/software/software/GenoDive.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GenoDive</a>, and you trusted that the methods were honest and appropriate (they are!). Part of the motivation behind PopGen.jl was to invest time into learning and understanding some of these methods I use, despite not coming from a mathematics or computer science background. Well, as I actually learn stuff and decode methods (no pun intended), I feel like it might be worthwhile to share some of my basic insights with others, in a way that I wish I could have been taught. So, this time it's <em>FST</em>. The purpose of this post is to cover the larger concepts without getting into the overwhelming math. Let's go!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-fst">What is FST?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-fst" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To understand <em>FST</em>, we need to start with <em>F</em>, the inbreeding coefficient devised by brilliant-but-ethically-questionable Sewall Wright. The <em>F</em> coefficient was a mathematically simple way to understand the level of inbreeding in a group, originally described for cattle breeds (the 🐄 part isn't relevant, but it's a fun fact). There were three circumstantial versions of <em>F</em>, denoted by very straightforward subscripted letters: <em>FIT</em>, <em>FIS</em>, <em>FST</em>. The <strong>I</strong> stands for <strong>I</strong>ndividual, <strong>S</strong> for <strong>S</strong>ubpopulation, <strong>T</strong> for <strong>T</strong>otal. The combination of letters explains what relationship you are measuring:  <em>FIT</em> was the comparison of <em>F</em> for an Individual vs the Total, <em>FIS</em> was the comparison of <em>F</em> for an Individual vs a Subpopulation. </p><p>Logically, <em>FST</em> would then mean you were looking at <em>F</em> for Subpopulations vs the Total, which  is where population geneticists get all excited. The values range from 0 to 1, with 0 being panmixia (fully mixed) and 1 being complete isolation. Although it <em>seems</em> like it would be linear, it's not-- Wright considered 0.125 to be the cutoff between panmictic and divergent. If one was to calculate <em>FST</em> for one large group of individuals and get a value &gt;0.125, this would suggest there is population subdivision happening (exciting!!). </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="pairwise-fst">Pairwise FST<a class="hash-link" href="#pairwise-fst" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Going one step further, you can narrow how you calculate <em>FST</em> to identify different trends. A "pairwise" <em>FST</em> is when you calculate <em>FST</em> for only a pair of populations at a time. With a pairwise <em>FST</em>, you are now testing if two populations are panmictic or divergent with <em>each other</em>.  Depending on your study system and the questions you're trying to answer, this can be extremely valuable information. </p><p>From a genetic standpoint, it looks kinda like this:
<img loading="lazy" alt="fst_diagram" src="/PopGen.jl/assets/images/FST-ada873bf402c073cbe3f6b386deb941a.png" width="1761" height="1401" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This is an over-simplified system (diploid, single locus, biallelic, <strong>ignoring Hardy-Weinberg stuff</strong>), but it demonstrates the point. When you are investigating two groups, if they are both completely heterozygous for the locus (for the same alleles), you would assume the groups are fully mixed (<em>FST</em> = 0). And that makes sense, right? Given the information required to calculate <em>FST</em>, it's a reasonable conclusion to say those alleles are constantly shared between the groups. And the opposite then should be true too: if both groups are completely fixed for different alleles (<em>FST</em> = 1), then they clearly aren't sharing alleles with each other.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="pitfalls">Pitfalls<a class="hash-link" href="#pitfalls" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Like I alluded to in the opening paragraph, <em>FST</em> (and it's derivatives) aren't a golden rule. There are natural phenomena that <em>FST</em> cannot account for, which may lead to misleading results or incorrect interpretations of results. For one, there are Hardy-Weinberg assumptions, so the presence of kin, overlapping generations, etc. kinda messes things up. Another is consideration is that the genetic data we collect now is only a snapshot in time.  If two populations are completely isolated from one another and have been for generations, but are long lived and slow to evolve, then <em>FST</em> may mislead you into believing they are panmictic (that happened in my <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-019-3533-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shark study</a>). These are just a few examples and there are more.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="significance-testing">Significance testing<a class="hash-link" href="#significance-testing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>One way of being more rigorous with <em>FST</em> values is significance testing (you know, generating those p-values everyone loves so much). So the question is, how do we do that? One common (frequentist) solution is permutation testing. The rationale is this: we get some kind of observed <em>FST</em> with our samples arranged in their natural populations, so would that  <em>FST</em> look the same if we shuffled the samples up? Honestly, that's the gist of it. We calculate our observed <em>FST</em> value, then we randomly shuffle the samples into two new populations and recalculate the pairwise <em>FST</em> for the new population pair. Then we just keep shuffling and recalculating <em>FST</em> a few thousands of times. After so many iterations, we compare how many times our observed (original) <em>FST</em> value was greater than the permuted <em>FST</em> values. This is known as a one-tailed test, since we're only interested in knowing if our observed <em>FST</em> is <em>greater</em> than randomness, meaning we're making the case that <em>FST</em> (and therefore divergence) is highest with our samples in this non-random population configuration. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="other-means">Other means<a class="hash-link" href="#other-means" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The field of population genetics has expanded tremendously since the Fisher and Wright era, and there are now all sorts of interesting ways to identify population subdivision. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, which is why it's good practice to try multiple things and find agreement between methods. At the time of this writing, PopGen.jl can calculate pairwise <em>FST</em> and perform significance testing using the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=UhRSsLkjxDgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP11&amp;ots=Qu7vO8EMmw&amp;sig=T6cTISYEEm-hL8aWU8EgeGgzP5E#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nei 1987</a>, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2408641?casa_token=_0gGbCbYpqMAAAAA:f9BvW9Xvx_8WaWSaRN4iqg0HB7KkaP21712ds28cTjhsvVQrYRTyHon7hKCcyHLcmTRA9H_1oM5iF3TZAl5xPm5gil2GmcGzHyEFFYAOl8pDVEBMQQ&amp;seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weir &amp; Cockerham 1984</a>, and <a href="https://www.genetics.org/content/132/2/583" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudson et al. 1992</a> methods.

Unfortunately, there is no right answer and you will need to use your discretion. Some people choose an estimator based on the heterozygosity of the data, others choose one based on more liberal or conservative values, and there are yet more criteria one can consider for choosing an estimator. To keep things simple, we're going to use <code>LynchLi</code>. Why? Because I'm the one writing this tutorial, and I said so 😁. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="the-steps">The Steps<a class="hash-link" href="#the-steps" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="1-calculate-pairwise-relatedness">1.

In order to do the analysis, you need you get the pairwise relatedness values for the individuals of interest in your data. To keep things simple, we're going to do an all-by-all comparison. But, we also want to boostrap the pairs to create confidence intervals ("CI") for each pair, so let's talk about that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="2-bootstrap-to-calculate-ci">2. Bootstrap to calculate CI<a class="hash-link" href="#2-bootstrap-to-calculate-ci" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It would behoove us to bootstrap the loci in a pairwise comparison <em>n</em> number of times so we can create a confidence interval for the relatedness estimates for each pair. This inflates the runtime of the analysis substantially, but it's a very useful method in making sense of our estimates. If one was to be conservative (and we generally are), then we would reject an estimate for a pair whose CI includes zero. In PopGen.jl, the estimates and bootstrapping are done all at once to minimize processing time, so the command for that would be</p><div class="language-julia codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-julia codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">julia</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">&gt;</span><span class="token plain"> rel_out  </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> kinship</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token plain">cats</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"> method </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> LynchLi</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"> iterations </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token number" style="color:#36acaa">1000</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>By default, the <code>kinship</code> function uses a 95% CI (<code>interval = (0.025, 0.975)</code>), but you can change that with <code>interval = (low,high)</code> where <code>low</code> and <code>high</code> are decimals of your quantiles.

The estimators all generally give you some value between 0-1 (or 0-0.5, same idea) and you can intuit that certain values mean certain things, like that <code>0</code> is "unrelated", <code>0.25</code> is "half-sib", and <code>0.5</code> is "full-sib". However, those are fixed values, so how do we know how far we can deviate from 0.25 (for example) and still call our pair half-siblings? Instead of hand-waving, we can create confidence intervals from simulated data to act as sibship ranges for our data. If this doesn't make sense yet, it will below.

To do this, we're going to use PopGenSims.jl to simulate data based on the allele frequencies in our data. What <code>simulatekin</code> does is simulate individuals based on the allele frequencies in your <code>PopData</code>, then simulate offspring of a particular siblingship resulting from the "mating" of those individuals. For example, when you specify <code>"fullsib"</code>, it generates two offspring resulting from two parents, <code>n</code> number of times. We want to do this for each of the three kinds of sibships.</p><div class="language-julia codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div

We are only interested in the values for the simulated pairs and not samples across pairs. If you aren't sure why that is, think of it this way: we're trying to create a range of values where we can confidently say unknown things are full-sibs (or half-sib, etc.), so we want to know what range of values we get from a bunch of known fullsib pairs, not the unknown relationships of samples between pairs. </p><p>It would a nightmare to manually specify only 2 individuals at a time into <code>kinship()</code>. Instead, the function has a shortcut built into it that will recognize the <code>population</code> names generated from <code>simulatekin</code> and only give you relatedness estimates for those pairs. So, we just need to run it once for each of our simulations, this time <em>without</em> bootstrapping because we are only interested in the estimates. Make sure to use the same estimator! The run will be a lot faster this time because it only needs to calculate estimates for 500 pairs each time (our <code>n</code> from above) and without bootstrapping. When not bootstrapping, <code>kinship()</code> returns a dataframe (versus a NamedTuple of dataframes).</p><div class="tabs-container tabList__CuJ"><ul role="tablist" aria-orientation="horizontal"

However, this tutorial covers what we consider a reasonable way to assess kinship in population genetic studies. If removing kin is your ultimate goal, consider the effects doing that may have on the analyses you are looking to do. Additionally, consider which individual of a pair you would remove and why. If you were curious as to how many identical loci a pair of samples may share, you can check that using <code>pairwiseidentical()</code>. Good luck!</p>]]></content:encoded>
